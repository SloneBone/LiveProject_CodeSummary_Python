 Summary and highlights of my work on Python Live Project.
 
<h1>Python Live Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a summary of a project I completed on  a two week sprint(1/11/21 - 1/25/21) working with Python and the powerful Django Framework.  I was tasked with building a interactive website for managing one's collection of things related to various hobbies, as well as API and Data Scraped content for those hobbies.  I decided to use sports as my hobby of interest-- more specifically the NBA.
